                        Hi! üëã I'm Om, a CS/BBA student and varsity XC/T&F athlete at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. If you're reading this, that means you've stumbled across my page. Welcome!
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Here you'll find some stuff I've built over the past few years and a bit about my experience. You'll also get to know me a little personally, like my unhealthy obsession with Bollywood music (check out the bottom left for my top listen this week) and my love for running.
                    </p>

                        Honestly, if I could describe myself in a nutshell, I'm just a super passionate uni student trying to figure it all out. I love learning, building cool stuff, and doing whatever I can to be the best version of myself.
